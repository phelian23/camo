          Our research is conducted within the main remits of space, communications and quantum computing. Our pilot research has investigated the use of satellite communications for collaborative healthcare diagnosis. We have also investigated the use of quantum computing techniques in operationalising and optimising artificial gas lift scenarios in marginal fields.
